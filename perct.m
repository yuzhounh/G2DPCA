function perct(t,i,n,k)
%PERCT The program procedure.
% PERCT(T,I,N,K) shows the program procedure and remaining time for loops. 
% Only K countdowns will be displayed. When the program is completed,
% output the total elapsed time with scale .0000 hours. 
% 
% t, time elapsed (seconds) recorded by "tic" and "toc"
% i, the number of loops that are completed
% n, the total number of loops
% k, the number of countdowns to be dispalyed, optional
%
% Example:
%     k=10;
%     tic;
%     for i=1:n
%         ...
%         perct(toc,i,n,k);
%     end
%
% Tips:
% 1, you might save the elapsed time by "time=toc/3600" after all loops
%   are completed.
% 2, "clc" before calling this function if you only want to see the current
%   countdown.
